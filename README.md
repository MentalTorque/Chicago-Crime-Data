# Chicago-Crime-Data

###Authored by Nicholas M. Staich

Created a dashboard for the 2001 to 2023 crime data from Chicago Police Department.  It included 4 dashboards:

### Landing Page

The landing Page is the front page of the dasboard, with the CPD logo, as well as navigation links using images hyperlinked to the Long Term Trend Analysis dashboards,
Crime Analysis dashboard, and interactive map dashboard.  

Also included was a byline for authoring and a link to the GitHub repo where it is housed via hyperlink in the GitHub logo.

### Long Term Analysis

The Long Term Analysis dashboard shows the annual changes in crime rates from 2001 to 2023, with hover and tooltip capabilities for improved granularity.  
Also included is a forecast analysis, showing the projected crime performance for the coming 12 months.

### Crime Analysis

This dashboard is highly interactive.  The user can select the crime type they wish to analyze, and it will automatically adjust the District display to reflect the 
crime amounts of that type by district.  The Daily Count will also adjust to show the distribution of crime by day of the week, with weekday and weekend category colored 
differently.  Both the Crime Type and District filters will impact the crime map, which shws the actual points of occurence on a street map of Chicago. 


### Interactive Crime Map

This is a larger version of the thumbnail map included on the Crime Analysis dashboard, for improved visibility and better tooltip clarity.
